This is a a modified version of the original carriage to allow use of M3x5x4 brass insets instead of threading directly into the plastic.

I have finally had the chance to print this for myself and test it and all of the issues I encountered have been resolved,but if you try it yourself, please feel free to
correct my work or let me know so I can.





Anyway, heres a pic of it on my printer. ![20220217_133009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99375733/154556830-a77953b9-1c75-418a-b1a2-033c2355a022.jpg)
