This is a reverse engineered model for the carriage derived from the original STL. 

It accounts for using M3x5x4 brass insets instead of directly threading into the plastic, but otherwise there are no other changes.

BE WARNED: This design is currently untested. I tried my best to get it as accurate as possible but it may need minor tweaking to work good.
(Either that or you can go at it with a powerdrill, doens't hurt my feelings, lol)

I will get to testing it myself shortly and will post here once I have gotten it working good myself.





Anyway, heres a CAD screenshot
