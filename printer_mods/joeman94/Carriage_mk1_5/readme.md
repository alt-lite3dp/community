This is a a modified version of the original carriage to allow use of M3x5x4 brass insets instead of threading directly into the plastic.

I have finally had the chance to print this for myself and test it and all of the issues I encountered have been resolved,but if you try it yourself, please feel free to
correct my work or let me know so I can.



DO NOTE. The size of the z stop tab is slightly different from the original, here is what a recommend doing to prevent a crash. Once you have the head mounted, turn on
the printer and allow the "Prepare" function to run WITHOUT the bed attached. Once it is at the bottom, you can use the up and down keys to trim the z level of the 
bed a few milimeters. Use the up key and trim it as far up as it will go. This is a setting that is saved in the printer firmware. Then press ok. Now, put your 
bed on and redo the prepare function. Use the up and down keys to adjust the bed as you see fit. I like to have a bit of friction with a piece of printer paper over the
screen like on an FDM printer, but I may be completly wrong about that. Works for me tho. 

This process should keep you from cracking the carriage and breaking your screen.




Anyway, heres a pic of it on my printer. ![20220217_133009](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99375733/154556830-a77953b9-1c75-418a-b1a2-033c2355a022.jpg)
