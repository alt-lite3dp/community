Problem
----------------------
Lite3DP-S1 comes with only one print platform and we need to do leveling every print.. What makes the issue worse, I play with it with different test print recently. 

As a result, It is time wasting because next print have to wait until I recover resin, remove print and clean the build platform.

Solution
--------------------------
Due to the small size of the printer, it is not difficult to make build platform with FDM 3D printer. 
Crastinblack already made a good start, but I prefer to make it more complete by print out the M4 thread and install Round Screw Ball (10mm diameter, M4 bore) specified by lite3DP.

Usage
---------------------------
Just print many!  (MagneticBuildPlatform_R1.stl) 
Then we can print immediately after the previous one finish. 
Printing can run parallel when recovering resin, removing print and cleaning the build platform. 

1. Place the model like this:

2. Screw in Steel Ball:

4. Use it as-is the origilan aliminium build plate
